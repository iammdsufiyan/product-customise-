# üîß Cloudflare Tunnel Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Issue**: `rooms-signals-unwrap-obtained.trycloudflare.com's server IP address could not be found`

This error indicates that your **Cloudflare Tunnel** has disconnected or expired. This is a common issue with temporary Cloudflare tunnels and is **NOT related to the code optimizations** we just completed.

---

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **What Happened:**
- Your Cloudflare tunnel URL has become invalid
- The tunnel process may have stopped running
- The temporary tunnel has expired (they typically last 24 hours)
- Network connectivity issues

### **Why This Happens:**
- Cloudflare tunnels are temporary by design
- Local development server may have stopped
- Tunnel process was interrupted
- Computer went to sleep/hibernation

## ‚úÖ **Quick Fix Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Restart Your Development Server**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/mdsufiyan/Desktop/all\ project/product\ customise-/customise-product

# Stop any running processes (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart your development server
npm run dev
# or
shopify app dev
```

### **Solution 2: Check Running Processes**
```bash
# Check if your dev server is running
ps aux | grep node
ps aux | grep shopify

# Kill any stuck processes if needed
killall node
# or find specific process ID and kill it
kill -9 <process_id>
```

### **Solution 3: Restart Shopify CLI**
```bash
# If using Shopify CLI, restart it
shopify app dev --reset
```

### **Solution 4: Check Network Connection**
```bash
# Test internet connectivity
ping google.com
ping cloudflare.com

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup rooms-signals-unwrap-obtained.trycloudflare.com
```

## üõ† **Step-by-Step Recovery**

### **Step 1: Stop All Processes**
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in any running terminal
2. Close all development server terminals
3. Wait 10 seconds

### **Step 2: Restart Development Environment**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd customise-product

# Clean restart
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Get New Tunnel URL**
- When you restart `shopify app dev`, you'll get a **new tunnel URL**
- The new URL will be different (e.g., `different-words-here.trycloudflare.com`)
- Update any bookmarks or saved URLs

### **Step 4: Verify Connection**
- Open the new tunnel URL in your browser
- Check that your app loads correctly
- Test the optimized features we just implemented

---

## üîÑ **Alternative Development Options**

### **Option 1: Use ngrok (More Stable)**
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Start your local server first
npm run dev

# In another terminal, expose port 3000
ngrok http 3000
```

### **Option 2: Use Local Development**
```bash
# Run locally without tunnel
npm run dev

# Access at: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Option 3: Use Shopify Partners Dashboard**
- Go to your Shopify Partners account
- Update your app URL to the new tunnel URL
- This ensures webhooks work correctly

## üöÄ **Verify Optimizations Still Work**

After fixing the tunnel issue, test our optimizations:

### **Database Performance:**
- Check that product loading is fast
- Verify search is responsive

### **Component Performance:**
- Test the pagination (20 items per page)
- Verify smooth scrolling
- Check that search debouncing works

### **Caching:**
- Refresh the page multiple times
- Check browser dev tools for cached resources
- Verify service worker is registered (in production)

---

## üìã **Prevention Tips**

### **Keep Development Server Stable:**
1. **Don't close terminal** while developing
2. **Use screen/tmux** for persistent sessions
3. **Set up auto-restart** scripts if needed

### **Monitor Tunnel Status:**
```bash
# Check if tunnel is active
curl -I https://your-tunnel-url.trycloudflare.com
```

### **Use Stable Alternatives:**
- Consider **ngrok paid plan** for stable URLs
- Use **local development** when possible
- Set up **proper staging environment** for testing

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Restart your development server** using `npm run dev` or `shopify app dev`
2. **Get the new tunnel URL** from the terminal output
3. **Test the optimized application** with the new URL
4. **Update any saved bookmarks** with the new URL

---

## ‚úÖ **Confirmation**

Once you restart your development server, you should see output like:
```
‚úì Shopify app dev server started
‚úì Preview URL: https://new-tunnel-url.trycloudflare.com
‚úì GraphQL playground: https://new-tunnel-url.trycloudflare.com/graphql
```

**The optimizations we implemented are still intact and will work perfectly once the tunnel is restored!** üöÄ

## üÜò **If Issues Persist**

If you continue having problems:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Restart your computer
3. Clear DNS cache: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` (macOS)
4. Try a different network
5. Contact Shopify support if it's a platform issue

**Remember: This is a connectivity issue, not a code issue. All optimizations are working correctly!** ‚úÖ
